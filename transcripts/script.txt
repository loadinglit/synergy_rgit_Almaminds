imagine being able to create full
0:02
YouTube videos not just Clips not just
0:04
shorts but full 10 to 20 minute YouTube
0:07
videos from a single text prompt while
0:10
everybody's talking about AI tools like
0:11
mid Journey for images and open AI Sora
0:14
and other tools like it for video clips
0:16
most of these tools are either
0:17
unavailable to the public limited to
0:19
brief Clips or stuck in the research
0:22
Labs but there's already an AI video
0:24
generator that's available to the public
0:26
that can create ready to monetize videos
0:29
with everything done for you from a
0:31
single prompt from the music to the
0:33
voiceovers to editing it all together to
0:35
generating the very video clips
0:37
themselves today I'm going to show you
0:39
this tool show you how to use it and
0:40
also discuss how content creation is
0:42
going to experience some massive shifts
0:44
and changes in 2025 that we all need to
0:47
be ready for you got to just press
0:49
record in the next few minutes I'm going
0:50
to show you exactly how inv video AI
0:52
version 3.0 is transforming content
0:55
creation you're going to see how to turn
0:57
any idea no matter how Wild is into a
1:01
professional video even if you're a
1:03
complete beginner and you know nothing
1:05
about video editing then I'll show you
1:07
how I use this to launch a completely
1:09
new YouTube channel with three videos on
1:11
it in under 2 hours first let's look at
1:14
what's possible with this tool Indiana
invideo AI Features & Examples
1:16
Jones discovers new age influencers at
1:19
Area 51 let's see what it comes up with
1:22
under the moonlit Desert Sky Indiana
1:24
Jones faces a tall barbed wire fence
1:27
Indie crouches cutting through the fence
1:29
the Des is quiet his face half lit by
1:32
the moon as he sneaks inside inside a
1:34
large dark hanger colorful neon lights
1:36
and faint music glow from behind strange
1:39
alien Tech man this hanger scene is cool
1:42
peeking around a corner Indie sees
1:43
aliens in shimmering outfits posing
1:45
under ring lights aliens take turns
1:48
posing practicing influencer gestures
1:50
adjusting lights and checking
1:52
Reflections Indiana's face is a mix of
1:54
confusion and shock as he watches the
1:56
Extraterrestrial influences so pretty
1:59
crazy right so the there was no editing
2:00
required for that that came from a
2:01
single prompt and I think it's worth it
2:03
to hit the like button for aliens doing
2:06
influencer dances in front of ring
2:07
lights but let's look at another example
2:09
create a 30 second ad for YouTube about
2:14
KFC if they made electric cars Kentucky
2:17
Fried Chicken buckle up America KFC
2:20
serving up something
2:22
electrifying introducing the colonel
2:24
mobile I drive this where fingerlicking
2:27
good meets zero emissions
2:30
enjoy the convenience of KFC's
2:33
drive-thru with our Cutting Edge
2:35
eco-friendly
2:37
technology KFC electric finger licking
2:39
good for the
2:40
planet that last shot's pretty crispy
2:43
and if they included chicken with your
2:45
purchase of the car for Life that'd be
2:48
the ultimate deal so the generative
2:50
videos being created by Nvidia AI 3.0
2:53
are pretty wild and so there's kind of
2:55
endless possibilities for your
2:57
creativity one of the coolest things
Using AI Tools to Create Kid-Friendly Content
2:59
about this tool is that the videos are
3:00
fully monetizable and so I wanted to
3:03
play around with like a concrete concept
3:05
and I launched a channel called Heroes
3:08
of the Bible animated stories of faith
3:11
and using AI one of the parts of this
3:14
tool is an image generator and there's
3:16
many image generators out there but it
3:18
is included in Nvidia AI 3.0 I set up
3:22
the Avatar figured out the branding
3:24
wrote my about page and actually was
3:26
able to create three videos in under two
3:29
hours for all of the above with a really
3:32
concrete niche in my opinion look at
3:34
these shots I think kind of the Lego
3:36
Vibe and the Minecraft Vibe which is two
3:38
I played around with work really good
3:39
for my channel you could go into
3:41
workflows in the software and you can go
3:43
to animated videos and they have these
3:46
like preet up Lego animation Style
3:49
Minecraft animation style you can also
3:51
do anime pretty diverse and that's just
3:54
one section of the workflows and in just
3:56
a second I'll show you in more detail
3:58
how to use this tool but really all you
4:00
need is just a single prompt you can
4:02
start typing it here you then start
4:04
building out the details but there is
4:06
something that I found helpful as well
4:08
which is a free thing you could use
4:09
called the AI video prompt generator
4:12
tool what I found is learning how to
4:16
talk to an AI it could be helpful to
4:19
start with a prompt generator like this
4:22
that's going to tell the scene and the
4:23
script and you sort of give it an
4:24
overview so actually what I did was I
4:26
just copied like a Biblical passage and
4:28
said hey could you turn turn this into a
4:30
kidfriendly
4:32
version with the voice over and a
4:34
description of the time period and then
4:36
I just reviewed and copy and pasted what
4:37
the AI prompt generator Pro came up with
4:40
and I think this is my best video yet
4:41
and all I did was use that GPT I took
4:43
the entire biblical passage which of
4:46
course is much more advanced plugged it
4:48
in and said I want this to be for kids
4:50
make sure to do the time period gave it
4:52
a few other instructions and then boom
4:54
Dro that in in video AI the voice over
4:56
the music the editing the scene I don't
4:59
even think I had to tweak any of the
5:01
scenes in this one and it turned out
5:02
with something that I actually really
5:04
like and I think was a good fit for this
5:06
faceless Channel I just started so if
5:08
you want to try this tool out for
5:09
yourself you can just use the link in
5:10
the description down below there is a
Using AI to Generate AI Prompts & Videos
5:12
couple levels to the software there's a
5:13
free plan A Plus and a Max but if you
5:16
actually want to be doing the generative
5:19
videos you want to be on the generative
5:21
plan so let's dive in and do a quick
5:23
tutorial about how easy this tool is to
5:24
use so when you log in you're given a
5:26
simple prompt window now you can do up
5:28
to 32,00 characters showing you that if
5:31
you want to get more advanced and very
5:32
specific again if you're going to build
5:34
out a longer prompt which is incredibly
5:36
easy to do if you're kind of running
5:39
with a blank mind if you start talking
5:41
to something like AI prompt generator
5:43
Pro which is free then you could build
5:46
out your idea or you could just give it
5:48
a simple sentence so let's imagine we
5:50
wanted to create kind of like a
5:52
Instagram real Tik Tok story uh type of
5:55
a video about detox tea um this maybe is
5:59
the entrepreneurial perspective you kind
6:01
of want to make a vertical video and so
6:03
uh mentioned the three benefits hyper
6:05
realistic use only generative Clips
6:07
Disney Pixar Animation style and use a
6:10
male Northern English voice for the
6:12
narrator so you could give the whole
6:14
prompt here but the other thing you can
6:15
do is you're able to you can click here
6:18
to use your script and create a video or
6:21
a YouTube video or Tik Tok video or
6:22
Instagram video and these are kind of
6:25
like starters you could create an
6:27
animated film type your topic put the
6:29
relev information in here you could
6:31
create an explainer video enter your
6:33
topic I want to make a up to 15minute
6:36
video about this topic and here's the
6:39
relevant information and again as you
6:41
scroll down the generated Clips that's
6:43
what you need 3.0 for right and it'll
6:46
generate everything only generated
6:48
images that's actually going to save you
6:50
some of the generative credits but
6:52
you'll still have all original images
6:53
and it will kind of animate them
6:55
throughout it and then you could also
6:56
use stock media which is included in the
6:59
generative plan but also some of the
7:01
other versions of nid AI lets you do
7:04
that and you can get as specific as you
7:06
want you could select the background
7:07
music and the pacing and you can change
7:09
that later the languages you want to put
7:11
it in you've got English and all the
7:13
different languages subtitles if you
7:16
want to have those on screen you can
7:17
select your voice actor of any male
7:20
female or my voice and it's really easy
7:23
to upload your voice and it'll sound
7:26
exactly like you you just upload a 30
7:28
second clip you make make sure you give
7:30
a disclaimer to say I give nid AI
7:32
permission to use my voice it won't be
7:35
shared with the public but then it'll
7:36
turn your voice into AI or you could
7:38
select clear American Voice California
7:41
accent New York accent there's so many
7:43
different choices old husky British
7:45
voice and then you could go different
7:47
speaker choices and see which one you
7:49
like and you could select if you want a
7:51
watermark or not your music preference
7:54
using the best audio available just the
7:56
YouTube audio library or story BLX AUD a
7:59
or just the best audio and that's going
8:01
to be royalty-free music and then you
8:03
could select use iock for um b-roll
8:08
Clips if that's part of it but for a lot
8:09
of this we're just going to be doing the
8:11
generative media and that just shows you
8:13
how detailed you can get again you could
8:15
just type in something very simple here
8:17
and skip to the workflows which will
8:20
kind of inspire you whether you want to
8:22
do a 15-second clip a 30second clip you
8:25
want to do an animated ad or a Tik Tock
8:28
Shop video or a food ad you want to do
8:31
different stories maybe you want to do a
8:32
horror film type of a story you're doing
8:35
a faceless channel uh you want to do
8:37
short films or fan art it's really
8:40
expansive and they make it very
8:42
userfriendly so I encourage you to check
8:44
it out if you're at all interested
8:45
especially because this whole generative
8:47
AI thing is really going to change
8:49
content creation so even if you're
8:51
unsure exactly how you might use it I
8:53
think it's important to start playing
8:55
with it so you're kind of aware of where
8:57
content creation is going but I'm going
8:58
to stick with my prompt and click
9:00
generate video so after a second it
9:02
gives me this screen for my video on
9:04
detox tea benefits you need to know and
9:07
so the duration of the video we could
9:09
say 30 seconds who's the audience Health
9:12
enthusiasts for the platform Tik Tok
9:14
YouTube shorts or Instagram reals I'm
9:16
going to say YouTube shorts and I'm
9:18
going to say continue for 30 seconds of
9:21
generated content now this is using
9:25
generative Ai and we're going to see the
9:28
result in just a second a few moments
9:31
later okay let's check out our video hey
9:33
up let's talk about a tea that's more
9:34
than just hot water shall we this ain't
9:37
your average Cupa it's detox tea and
9:40
it's got some proper benefits first off
9:42
it gives your immune system a right good
9:44
boost like having a bouncer for your
9:46
body then there's the detoxification
9:49
it's like spring cleaning for your
9:50
insides mate and get this it helps
9:53
purify your blood and might even help
9:54
with weight loss so fancy a brew that
9:57
does all that grab yourself some detox
9:59
tea and drink up your body will thank
10:02
you so the results here are pretty
10:04
impressive and this is definitely the
10:06
animation style that I asked for in my
10:09
prompt and Not only was this video
10:11
generated from a single prompt but you
10:13
can make simple edits using text prompts
10:16
as well now we'll look at some Advanced
10:17
features in a second but all you have to
10:19
do to make changes is Type in an
10:21
additional prompt like if you want to
10:23
make a certain chapter of the video half
10:25
as long a little less wordy you just
10:27
tell it that let's just say we wanted to
10:28
change
10:29
the voice over to female it's that
10:32
simple let's check it out let's talk
10:34
about a tea that's more than just hot
10:36
water shall we this ain't your average
10:38
copper it's detox tea and it's got some
10:41
proper benefits first off it gives your
10:43
immune system a right good boost like
10:45
having a bouncer for your body then so
10:48
are you starting to see how this could
10:49
transform your entire approach to
10:51
content creation but let's go a little
10:53
bit deeper if we click edit we can get
10:55
much more granular if we want in the
10:58
edits we can see here that scene by
11:00
scene we could switch these out if we
11:02
wanted to upload media from our library
11:05
I have clips that I've uploaded you
11:07
could also just insert some stock media
11:10
here which would tap into some of your
11:13
credits in your in video AI account if
11:17
you wanted to include that or you could
11:19
just generate a new clip and it's going
11:21
to give you all of your previous Clips
11:24
you can see my Clips here from my Bible
11:27
animation Channel but you can generate
11:29
new clips if you want and you could also
11:31
remix Clips going a little bit deeper we
Optimizing Video Content with Music and Scripts
11:33
could change the music if we want we
11:35
could select more from the stock music
11:37
library or you could upload a song if
11:40
you got that from somewhere else
11:41
original music or maybe some other
11:44
royaltyfree music site that you wanted
11:46
to use you can go in and adjust the
11:48
script very easily you could actually
11:50
change the exact words that are being
11:53
said and this was you know using Kaa and
11:56
language like that it's kind of like an
11:58
Australian audience in this this case so
12:00
if you wanted to switch the script up
12:01
you could do that as well and then under
12:03
settings you can add overlays like if
12:06
you kind of want like particles over the
12:08
video a lot of faceless channels do that
12:10
kind of stuff you could do different
12:12
transition presets subtitle presets in
12:15
terms of what the onscreen subtitles are
12:17
looking like and you can then adjust all
12:19
the different volumes what levels the
12:21
voice over out compared to the music
12:23
compared to the sound effects all pretty
12:25
easy but if you don't want to dive into
12:27
that detail it's no big deal and what's
12:29
really crazy if you start thinking about
12:31
a global audience and even if you going
12:33
to do like a facist or automation
12:35
Channel or you were doing ads on social
12:37
media and you wanted to do them in other
12:39
languages imagine this we could say
12:42
change voice over and subtitles to
12:44
Spanish and then just click generate
12:46
let's see what we
12:48
[Music]
12:50
get what
12:53
[Music]
13:06
what are we even talking about so if you
13:07
think about what this means for reaching
13:08
a global audience one video could easily
13:11
become 10 each video translated and
13:14
culturally adapted to different markets
13:17
now I've got some really cool things
13:18
that I still need to show you but if we
Advanced Features and Capabilities
13:20
want to finish up this particular video
13:22
and we're done with it we're happy with
13:24
the results we've you know dialed in our
13:26
Clips voiceover script whatever we just
13:28
click down download and then I'm going
13:30
to select no watermarks no in video AI
13:33
branding and make sure that it's 1080P
13:35
and click continue and now the video is
13:38
going to export onto my computer and I
13:41
could upload that wherever I want to any
13:44
of the vertical platforms YouTube
13:46
YouTube shorts that's all you got to do
13:48
but I also want to make sure if you're
13:49
checking out and using this tool you're
13:50
going to want to go in here to settings
13:53
you're going to want to make sure beta
13:54
features is turned on now this is going
13:56
to make sure you have access to all the
13:58
different features if you want to have
14:00
more advanced use of the software and
14:02
let's just go through these there's
14:03
different plugins there is voices where
14:06
you can add your own voice you can see
14:07
I've uploaded my voice and a think media
14:09
voice and uh really easy to do if you
14:12
want to just turn out videos with your
14:14
own voice you can do text to a clip one
14:17
of the use cases you can imagine here is
14:19
if all you wanted to do is have an AI
14:22
video generator for b-roll for your own
14:24
videos so if you are a content creator
14:29
that is looking for b-roll and you want
14:31
some original or very creative b-roll
14:34
for videos where maybe you are on camera
14:36
you could just do oneoff Clips very easy
14:39
you can also do text to image you can
14:40
see some of the Lego thumbnails I was
14:43
generating here you can do photos to
14:45
clip text to clip and then there's also
14:47
a whole preset library that allows you
14:50
to get very detailed and so what's cool
14:52
about this tool is that it's super
14:54
userfriendly if you know nothing you're
14:56
a total beginner and you just want to do
14:58
prompt but as you start to learn what is
15:01
cool is they've added a lot of nuance
15:03
here so that you do have creative
15:05
flexibility and you could scale up your
15:07
content creation efforts now in this
15:09
next part of the video I just want to
15:10
share a few thoughts strategically on
15:11
maybe who this software is for and sort
15:14
of like a value proposition breakdown if
15:16
you study traditional video production
15:19
cost they say that it costs anywhere
15:21
from $11,000 to
15:23
$5,000 per minute of finished video now
15:27
that's going to be like on a PR
15:28
professional set you've got a team
15:30
you've got all the gear and this is
15:32
definitely different than that but if
15:33
you think about it a 10-minute video
15:35
could be anywhere from $10,000 to
15:38
$50,000 if you've created any content at
15:40
all you know that time goes into
15:42
research time goes into preparation
15:45
filming if you're going to film
15:47
voiceovers narration all of the above it
15:50
makes sense that a YouTube video takes
15:52
from 10 to 20 hours depending on what
15:54
that final product is but the fact that
15:56
you can get your monthly generative
15:59
credits and create 10 to 20 minute
16:01
videos if you want is pretty wild
16:05
considering the value proposition and as
16:07
you can see here it has drastically cut
16:10
down the time of all of the above you
16:13
can see how quickly you'd be able to
16:14
scale and really compress time because
16:16
of where generative AI is going and one
16:18
of the things that gets me excited about
How Generative AI will Impact Content Creation
16:20
this is personally I've been doing video
16:22
since 2003 so that's like 22 years and I
16:25
just think about the learning curve
16:27
which is an incredible journey to be on
16:29
but there's so many new people getting
16:30
into the game right now they don't know
16:32
how to edit they don't know color
16:33
grading pacing scripting tools like this
16:36
are absolutely going to transform the
16:38
landscape of content creation and upand
16:41
cominging content creators and those
16:44
that are AI minded that are becoming
16:47
prompt Architects right and getting
16:49
smart with this kind of stuff I really
16:51
believe are going to be shaping the
16:52
future you know as we see this tool
16:54
there's certainly some scenes that I had
16:56
to go in and replace or make tweaks to
16:58
the cool thing is you're only really
17:00
limited by your Creative Vision so if
17:02
you want to actually check this out use
17:04
the link in the description down below
17:05
if you want to be accessing the
17:07
generative AI features make sure to
17:10
select the generative plan and you can
17:12
see all of the details when you click
17:15
that link and if you're interested I
17:16
just did a brand new video with some of
17:18
